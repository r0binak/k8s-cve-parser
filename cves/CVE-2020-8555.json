  "summary": "Half-Blind SSRF in kube-controller-manager",
  "content_text": "CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)\r\n\r\nThere exists a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in kube-controller-manager that allows certain authorized users to leak up to 500 bytes of arbitrary information from unprotected endpoints within the master's host network (such as link-local or loopback services).\r\n \r\nAn attacker with permissions to create a pod with certain built-in Volume types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageOS, ScaleIO) or permissions to create a StorageClass can cause kube-controller-manager to make GET requests or POST requests without an attacker controlled request body from the master's host network.\r\n \r\n### Am I vulnerable?\r\n\r\nYou may be vulnerable if:\r\n\r\n- You are running a vulnerable version (see below)\r\n- There are unprotected endpoints normally only visible from the Kubernetes master (including link-local metadata endpoints, unauthenticated services listening on localhost, or other services in the master's private network)\r\n- Untrusted users can create pods with an affected volume type or modify storage classes.\r\n\r\n#### Affected Versions\r\n\r\n- kube-controller-manager v1.18.0\r\n- kube-controller-manager v1.17.0 - v1.17.4\r\n- kube-controller-manager v1.16.0 - v1.16.8\r\n- kube-controller-manager \u003c= v1.15.11\r\n \r\nThe affected volume types are: GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageOS, ScaleIO\r\n\r\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\r\n\r\nPrior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by adding endpoint protections on the master or restricting usage of the vulnerable volume types (for example by constraining usage with a [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#volumes-and-file-systems) or third-party admission controller such as [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper)) and restricting StorageClass write permissions through RBAC.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed Versions\r\n\r\nThe information leak was patched in the following versions:\r\n\r\n- kube-controller-manager master - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89794\r\n- kube-controller-manager v1.18.1+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89796\r\n- kube-controller-manager v1.17.5+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89837\r\n- kube-controller-manager v1.16.9+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89838\r\n- kube-controller-manager v1.15.12+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89839\r\n\r\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#upgrading-a-cluster\r\n\r\n## Additional Details\r\n\r\nExploitation of this vulnerability causes the kube-controller-manager to make a request to a user-supplied, unvalidated URL. The request does not include any kube-controller-manager client credentials.\r\n\r\n#### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was reported by Brice Augras from Groupe-Asten and Christophe Hauquiert from Nokia.\r\n\r\n/area security\r\n/kind bug\r\n/committee product-security\r\n/sig storage\r\n/area controller-manager",
